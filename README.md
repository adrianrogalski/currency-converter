# Currency Converter App
A simple currency app build using *inlinelink(nbp.pl) API and JavaFX
## Goal
The goal here was to practice basic usage of advanced Java functions like streams, generic types and lambda functions moreover I wanted to use some architecture like service and divide my project into proper packages(repositories and models, service functionality, exceptions). While building the final app I tried to apply OOP mechanisms build in Java and use some of the JavaFx framework functionalities.
